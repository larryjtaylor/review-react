These last two weeks, I have felt entirely lost. I have been able to keep up with the coursework and build the projects by following along with the directions, but I have been nearly oblivious to what I was doing, as this information felt much more dense than previous sections and I have struggled to understand what I was actually doing. It felt like I was watching The Wire or Game of Thrones with about 3 weeks in between episodes. It was hard to keep track of relationships, events, plot points, etc... Then, yesterday, I went back to the beginning of last weeks lessons and went through them with the benefit of hindsight and the context of what was to come. I continued today with this weeks lessons and let me say... the comprehension difference was light and day. To continue my tv analogy, it was like binge-watching The Wire. Finally I was able to go through and make connections and have the context to make sense of redux, jest, etc... Then, going through some of the included links in epicenter today, things were actually making sense. I decided the best way to structure my day was to review past information, as I felt the simply pushing forward and building another "queue" type app and not really understanding how it worked would be counter productive. But today was fantastically useful, just being able to slow down and really absorb the structure and processes. So while I don't have a 'project' per se, I can say I am lightyears of where I was just 2 days ago.
