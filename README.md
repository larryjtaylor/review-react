# Rect & Redux

_React review 09/22/2017_

By _Larry Taylor_

## Description

Today was unbelievably helpful. I was able to use my day making sure I wasn't just going through the motions, but was actually comprehending what I was working on.

## Review Objectives

* Question 1: How you spent your eight hours today?
  * I began my day picking up where I left off yesterday, when I had began at the beginning of the rEact fundamentals lessons. I began on `Best Practices and Lifting Complex State.` I made my way through the rest of the curriculum through `Advanced Routing with React-Router & Removing Items from State,` making sure to take time to actually understand what I was reading and how it connected with everything else. I then went on to read `Lessons and resources linked in our React-Router lesson` and `This article on tackling React with Redux.` I have to say, having this day to go back and review with the context of the projects we built, and having moments of "Oh that's what that meant," was the most helpful way I could have spent the day.

* Question 2: What work you would like to priorities to do to prepare yourself for the weeks to come?
  * I am excited to get into incorporating databases with React. Especially with the app I have in mind for my cornerstone project, being able to store data will be imperative. I am also excited about the possibilities with React Router and how that will play a part in more complex apps. My project will need to be able to incorporate data from many different companies and be able to handle switching between them, so I know React-router will be helpful for that.

* Question 3: Which, if any, questions regarding technical or non-technical issues need further work in order for you to feel comfortable?
  * I think the main thing was just the amount of complex information thrown at us over the last 2 weeks. Obviously, with us being the first group to go thru it, it is to be expected that the curriculum will not be in ideal shape. But like I said above, having this day to go back over things was monumentally helpful.
